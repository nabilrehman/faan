# DESIGN REFERENCE — VEGA.IO STYLE

The site should look and feel like vega.io — NOT a typical dark SaaS template.

## Vega.io Design DNA:
- **Light, playful, illustrated** — NOT dark theme
- Soft cream/warm white backgrounds with sections in different warm colors
- Custom illustrations and playful graphics (pixel art style, organic shapes)
- Bold, oversized typography for headlines
- Smooth scroll animations
- Rounded cards with soft shadows
- Gradient accents (green, blue, warm tones)
- Scrolling marquee/ticker text sections
- Architecture/flow diagrams that look hand-drawn or illustrated
- Footer with illustrated landscape/scene
- Overall vibe: "serious product, playful presentation"
- Trust signals woven in naturally, not corporate
- Clean whitespace, breathing room between sections

## Color Palette (inspired by Vega but adapted for FAAN):
- Background: Warm cream (#f5f0e8) or soft white
- Primary accent: Emerald green (#34d399 or #10b981)
- Secondary: Warm amber/gold for highlights
- Text: Dark charcoal (#1a1a2e)
- Cards: White with subtle borders
- Section backgrounds: Alternating warm tones (cream, soft sage, light amber)
- Interactive elements: Green buttons with hover effects

## Typography:
- Headlines: Bold, large, maybe slightly playful sans-serif
- Body: Clean, readable
- Monospace accents for technical details (pricing, specs)

## Key Design Elements to Include:
1. Scrolling marquee section showing use cases (like Vega's "What can SEM do for you" ticker)
2. Illustrated comparison section (DIY vs FAAN) — make it visual, not just a boring table
3. Pricing cards with rounded corners, soft shadows, green CTA buttons
4. Flow diagram for "How It Works" — illustrated, not just numbered steps
5. FAQ as an accordion with smooth animations
6. Footer with a fun illustrated scene (lobster/claw theme could work since OpenClaw uses 🦞)
7. Animated elements on scroll (fade in, slide up)
8. Pill/tag buttons for use cases section

## DO NOT:
- Use dark theme
- Use generic SaaS template styling
- Make it look corporate
- Use stock photos
- Use harsh gradients
